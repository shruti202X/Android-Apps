## (Example 1)[Example_TimeActivity.java]

In this example, the timer is set to one minute (60000 milliseconds) but you can adjust the `timeLeftInMillis` variable to your desired timer duration.

This code sets up a timer with start, pause, and reset functionality. The countdown is displayed in a `TextView` and updates every second using the `CountDownTimer` class.

Remember to add the necessary permissions and dependencies in your app's `AndroidManifest.xml` and `build.gradle` files, respectively.

## Accuracy of `CountDownTImer`

The `CountDownTimer` class in Android provides a convenient way to implement a countdown timer functionality. However, it's important to note that the accuracy of the `CountDownTimer` class is dependent on the underlying system timer.

The accuracy of the `CountDownTimer` class can vary depending on several factors, including the device's hardware, system load, and other running processes. In general, it provides reasonable accuracy for most purposes, such as displaying a countdown in a timer app or triggering an action after a certain duration.

The `CountDownTimer` class uses the `Handler` mechanism to update the countdown at regular intervals. It's worth noting that the actual countdown interval may not be exactly precise due to system overhead and delays. The class tries to compensate for any discrepancies and adjusts the countdown to ensure the elapsed time matches the expected duration as closely as possible.

If you require more precise timing, such as for high-performance applications or critical operations, you may need to consider using alternative mechanisms, such as the `Timer` class or custom implementations using threads and handlers. These alternatives offer more control over the timing but require more careful management and synchronization to ensure accuracy.

In summary, the `CountDownTimer` class is generally accurate enough for most common use cases, but for applications that require precise timing, it's important to consider the limitations and explore alternative approaches if necessary.
