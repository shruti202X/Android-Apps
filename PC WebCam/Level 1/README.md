To access a phone's camera and microphone in an Android app, you'll need to use the Camera API and the MediaRecorder API. Here's an overview of the process:

1. Request permissions: Declare the necessary permissions in your app's AndroidManifest.xml file:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
```
Additionally, starting from Android 6.0 (API level 23), you need to request these permissions at runtime from the user.

2. Set up Camera: Use the Camera API to access the phone's camera. This involves creating a Camera object, opening the camera, setting the preview display, and configuring camera parameters such as resolution, focus, and flash.
- Official Android Camera documentation: [Camera](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/Camera)
- Newer documentation: [camera2](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/camera2/package-summary)

3. Capture images or record video: Once the camera is set up, you can capture images or record video using the Camera API. This involves implementing callbacks to handle capturing events and managing the camera's lifecycle properly.
- Official Android Camera documentation: [Taking Photos](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/camera#capture-images)
- Official Android Camera documentation: [Recording Videos](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/camera#capture-video)

4. Access the microphone: To access the phone's microphone, you can use the MediaRecorder API. This involves creating a MediaRecorder object, setting the audio source, format, and output file, and starting and stopping the recording.
- Official Android MediaRecorder documentation: [MediaRecorder](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaRecorder)

Note: Starting from Android 10 (API level 29), using the Camera API has been deprecated in favor of the CameraX API. CameraX provides a higher-level and more consistent camera framework. You may consider using CameraX for your camera-related tasks.
- Official Android CameraX documentation: [CameraX Overview](https://developer.android.com/training/camerax)

For more detailed information, sample code, and best practices, I recommend referring to the official Android documentation provided by Google. Here are some relevant links:

# Getting started with Camera:

The Camera API in Android provides several parameters that you can adjust to control the behavior and characteristics of the camera. Here are some common camera parameters you can configure:

1. Camera ID: Specifies which camera to use (front or rear).
2. Flash Mode: Controls the flash behavior, such as turning it on, off, or setting it to auto mode.
3. Focus Mode: Determines how the camera focuses, including auto-focus, continuous focus, or fixed focus.
4. Exposure Compensation: Adjusts the exposure level of the camera.
5. White Balance: Sets the color temperature of the camera, such as daylight, cloudy, or fluorescent.
6. Scene Mode: Optimizes camera settings for specific scenes, such as night, portrait, or landscape.
7. Zoom: Controls the zoom level of the camera.
8. Picture Size: Specifies the resolution of the captured images.
9. Preview Size: Sets the size of the preview frames displayed on the screen.
10. Video Size: Defines the resolution of the recorded video.
11. Auto Exposure Lock: Locks the exposure settings to prevent changes.
12. Auto White Balance Lock: Locks the white balance settings to prevent changes.
13. Orientation: Sets the orientation of the camera preview and captured images/videos.
14. HDR Mode: Enables or disables HDR (High Dynamic Range) for photos.

These are just a few examples of camera parameters available through the Camera API. The specific set of parameters supported can vary depending on the device and camera hardware.

To configure camera parameters, you can use the Camera.Parameters class in the Camera API or the Camera2 API (for Android 5.0 and higher). Here's an example of how to access and set camera parameters using the Camera API:

```java
// Open the camera
Camera camera = Camera.open(cameraId);

// Get the camera parameters
Camera.Parameters parameters = camera.getParameters();

// Adjust camera parameters
parameters.setFlashMode(Camera.Parameters.FLASH_MODE_AUTO);
parameters.setFocusMode(Camera.Parameters.FOCUS_MODE_AUTO);
parameters.setPictureSize(pictureWidth, pictureHeight);
// ...

// Apply the updated parameters
camera.setParameters(parameters);
```

It's important to note that the Camera2 API provides a more flexible and advanced way to handle camera functionality, including accessing and configuring camera parameters. However, the usage of Camera2 API is more complex and requires additional code compared to the older Camera API.

For more detailed information on camera parameters and their usage, I recommend referring to the official Android documentation:

- Official Android Camera documentation: [Camera.Parameters](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/Camera.Parameters)
- Official Android Camera2 documentation: [CameraCharacteristics](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/camera2/CameraCharacteristics)

These resources will provide you with a comprehensive list of camera parameters available and guidelines on how to use them in your Android app.

For a simple Android audio video recorder app, here are some essential features:

1. Start and Stop Recording: Provide buttons or controls to start and stop the recording process.

2. Camera Selection: Allow users to choose between the front and rear cameras, if their device supports multiple cameras.

3. Audio Recording: Enable simultaneous audio recording along with video capture.

4. Recording Duration: Display the duration of the ongoing recording and give users the ability to set a maximum recording time if desired.

5. Recording Indicator: Provide a visual indication, such as a recording icon or a red dot, to show that recording is in progress.

6. Storage Management: Allow users to specify the storage location for recorded videos and manage the recorded files, such as deleting or sharing them.

7. Preview and Playback: After recording, enable users to preview the recorded video and audio.

8. Video Quality and Resolution: Provide options to adjust the video quality and resolution settings according to user preferences.

9. Flash Control: Include an option to control the flash settings during video recording, if the device has a built-in flash.

10. Settings: Offer additional settings such as audio source selection, video stabilization, or audio gain control.

Regarding the `<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera" />` declaration in the AndroidManifest.xml file, it is used to indicate that your app requires access to a camera. By declaring this feature, you ensure that the app is only installed on devices that have a camera available.

Including this declaration is essential if your app relies on camera functionality, such as recording video. If a user's device doesn't have a camera or the camera is disabled, the app won't be available for installation on that device from the Google Play Store. However, keep in mind that users can still sideload the app on unsupported devices.

Including the `<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera" />` declaration is generally recommended if your app specifically requires camera access.

---

# <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />

The `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission is required to write data (including audio and video files) to the external storage of the device, such as the SD card or shared internal storage. By declaring this permission, you ensure that your app has the necessary access rights to save the recorded audio-video combinations to the device's storage.

Without this permission, your app will not be able to write the audio-video files to the device's storage, and you may encounter runtime errors or permission-related issues when attempting to save the recorded content.

Please note that starting from Android 11 (API level 30), there are new storage access changes and restrictions. You may need to handle storage access using the scoped storage approach and request the appropriate runtime permissions.

To ensure compatibility with devices running different Android versions and adhere to the best practices, it's recommended to handle storage permissions properly and provide fallback options if the permission is not granted.

In addition to the `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission, don't forget to also include the necessary permissions for camera and microphone access, which are:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
```

Including all these permissions in your AndroidManifest.xml file will ensure that your app has the required access rights to the camera, microphone, and storage, allowing you to capture and save audio-video combinations on the device.

# [android.hardware.camera2](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/camera2/package-summary)

This package models a camera device as a pipeline, which takes in input requests for capturing a single frame, captures the single image per the request, and then outputs one capture result metadata packet, plus a set of output image buffers for the request. The requests are processed in-order, and multiple requests can be in flight at once. Since the camera device is a pipeline with multiple stages, having multiple requests in flight is required to maintain full framerate on most Android devices.

To enumerate, query, and open available camera devices, obtain a CameraManager instance.

To capture or stream images from a camera device, the application must first create a camera capture session with a set of output Surfaces for use with the camera device, with createCaptureSession(SessionConfiguration). Each Surface has to be pre-configured with an appropriate size and format (if applicable) to match the sizes and formats available from the camera device. A target Surface can be obtained from a variety of classes, including SurfaceView, SurfaceTexture via Surface(SurfaceTexture), MediaCodec, MediaRecorder, Allocation, and ImageReader.

[Example of Java code that demonstrates how to access a camera using the android.hardware.camera2 interface in Android](ExampleMainActivityCamera.java)

If you need to ensure that the camera device supports certain capabilities, such as autofocus or flash, before opening the camera, then the first approach with capability checks is more appropriate. By checking the capabilities, you can make decisions based on the supported features of the camera. For example, you may want to display a warning message or disable certain camera functionalities if the camera lacks autofocus or flash capabilities.
```java
int[] capabilities = characteristics.get(CameraCharacteristics.REQUEST_AVAILABLE_CAPABILITIES);
if (capabilities != null) {
    for (int capability : capabilities) {
        if (capability == CameraCharacteristics.REQUEST_AVAILABLE_CAPABILITIES_AUTOFOCUS
                || capability == CameraCharacteristics.REQUEST_AVAILABLE_CAPABILITIES_FLASH) {
            // Camera supports the desired features, proceed with opening the camera
            cameraManager.openCamera(cameraId, cameraCallback, null);
            return;
        }
    }
}
```

On the other hand, if your app doesn't have any specific requirements regarding camera capabilities and you just need to open the camera regardless of the supported features, then the second approach without capability checks is simpler and more straightforward.
```java
private void openCamera() {
    CameraManager cameraManager = (CameraManager) getSystemService(Context.CAMERA_SERVICE);
    try {
        String cameraId = cameraManager.getCameraIdList()[0]; // Assuming first camera
        cameraManager.openCamera(cameraId, cameraCallback, null);
    } catch (CameraAccessException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```

[openCamera](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/camera2/CameraManager#openCamera(java.lang.String,%20android.hardware.camera2.CameraDevice.StateCallback,%20android.os.Handler)): Open a connection to a camera with the given ID.
[CameraDevice.StateCallback](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/camera2/CameraDevice.StateCallback): A callback objects for receiving updates about the state of a camera device.

In the above code, we have created a Camera Manager object and we have used it to simply open an available camera.

---


To capture and stream images from the opened camera device, you can modify the code as follows:

1. Add a `SurfaceView` or `TextureView` to your activity's layout XML file (`activity_main.xml` in this example):
```xml
<FrameLayout
    android:id="@+id/cameraPreviewContainer"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent">
    <SurfaceView
        android:id="@+id/cameraPreviewSurface"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent" />
</FrameLayout>
```

2. Modify the `openCamera()` method to create a capture session and configure it to stream images to the `SurfaceView`:
```java
private void openCamera() {
    CameraManager cameraManager = (CameraManager) getSystemService(Context.CAMERA_SERVICE);
    try {
        String cameraId = cameraManager.getCameraIdList()[0]; // Assuming first camera
        CameraCharacteristics characteristics = cameraManager.getCameraCharacteristics(cameraId);

        // Check if the camera supports the desired features
        // Here, we are checking for AUTOFOCUS and FLASH support
        int[] capabilities = characteristics.get(CameraCharacteristics.REQUEST_AVAILABLE_CAPABILITIES);
        if (capabilities != null) {
            for (int capability : capabilities) {
                if (capability == CameraCharacteristics.REQUEST_AVAILABLE_CAPABILITIES_AUTOFOCUS
                        || capability == CameraCharacteristics.REQUEST_AVAILABLE_CAPABILITIES_FLASH) {
                    // Camera supports the desired features, proceed with opening the camera
                    cameraManager.openCamera(cameraId, new CameraDevice.StateCallback() {
                        @Override
                        public void onOpened(@NonNull CameraDevice camera) {
                            cameraDevice = camera;
                            // Camera is successfully opened, you can start using it
                            Log.d(TAG, "Camera opened");
                            // Create a capture session and configure it
                            createCaptureSession();
                        }

                        @Override
                        public void onDisconnected(@NonNull CameraDevice camera) {
                            cameraDevice.close();
                            cameraDevice = null;
                            Log.d(TAG, "Camera disconnected");
                        }

                        @Override
                        public void onError(@NonNull CameraDevice camera, int error) {
                            cameraDevice.close();
                            cameraDevice = null;
                            Log.e(TAG, "Camera error: " + error);
                        }
                    }, null);
                    return;
                }
            }
        }
    } catch (CameraAccessException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }

    SurfaceHolder surfaceHolder = cameraPreviewSurfaceView.getHolder();
    surfaceHolder.addCallback(new SurfaceHolder.Callback() {

                outputSurfaces.add(holder.getSurface());
                cameraDevice.createCaptureSession(outputSurfaces, new CameraCaptureSession.StateCallback() {

            // Handle the changes if needed
        }

        @Override
        public void surfaceDestroyed(@NonNull SurfaceHolder holder) {
            // Surface destroyed
            // Clean up resources if needed
        }
    });
}
```

[Example Code File](ExampleMainActivityCamera2.java)

In this code, we've added a `SurfaceView` to the layout to serve as the preview surface for the camera. We obtain the `SurfaceHolder` from the `SurfaceView` and use it to create a capture session with the camera device. The `createCaptureSession()` method takes a list of output `Surface` objects, in this case, we only add the `Surface` from the `SurfaceView` to stream the camera preview.

Once the capture session is configured successfully in the `onConfigured()` callback, you can start capturing or streaming images using the camera device. You can add the necessary logic to capture images, record videos, or perform other operations based on your requirements.

Remember to handle the lifecycle of the camera properly. In the provided code, the camera device is closed in the `onDestroy()` method to release resources when the activity is destroyed.

---

The camera lifecycle in Android consists of several stages that you need to manage to ensure proper usage and resource handling. Here are the various stages of the camera lifecycle:

1. Requesting Camera Permissions:
   - Before accessing the camera, you need to request the necessary camera permissions from the user. You can use the `requestPermissions()` method to request the `Manifest.permission.CAMERA` permission from the user.

2. Opening the Camera:
   - Once the camera permission is granted, you can proceed to open the camera using the `CameraManager` class.
   - Call the `openCamera()` method on the `CameraManager` instance to open the camera.
   - Provide a `CameraDevice.StateCallback` object as a parameter to handle the camera device's state changes.

3. Configuring the Capture Session:
   - After successfully opening the camera, the next step is to configure the capture session.
   - Use the `CameraDevice` instance obtained from the `onOpened()` callback to create a capture session.
   - You need to provide a list of output `Surface` objects to the `createCaptureSession()` method. These surfaces define where the captured images or preview frames will be sent.
   - Implement the `CameraCaptureSession.StateCallback` interface to handle session state changes.
   - In the `onConfigured()` callback, you can start capturing or streaming images.

4. Capturing or Streaming Images:
   - Once the capture session is configured, you can start capturing or streaming images.
   - Use the `CameraCaptureSession` instance obtained from the `onConfigured()` callback to create capture requests.
   - Capture requests define the parameters for capturing images, such as the target `Surface` and the desired capture mode (e.g., still image or continuous streaming).
   - You can use methods like `capture()` or `setRepeatingRequest()` on the `CameraCaptureSession` to initiate capture requests.

5. Handling Camera Events:
   - During the camera usage, you need to handle various camera events to ensure smooth operation.
   - Implement the appropriate methods of the `CameraDevice.StateCallback` interface to handle events like the camera being opened, disconnected, or encountering an error.
   - Implement the `CameraCaptureSession.StateCallback` interface to handle events related to the capture session, such as it being configured or encountering an error.

6. Releasing Camera Resources:
   - Properly release camera resources when you no longer need them to avoid resource leaks.
   - Close the `CameraDevice` and `CameraCaptureSession` instances in the appropriate callbacks, such as `onDestroyed()` or when you are finished with the camera.
   - Releasing camera resources ensures that other applications can access the camera and improves the overall system performance.

By managing these stages of the camera lifecycle, you can effectively utilize the camera functionality in your Android app while handling resource allocation, configuration changes, and camera events gracefully.

---

The `android.hardware.camera2` package provides classes and interfaces for working with the camera device in Android. Here are the important classes and their methods involved in the camera capture process:

1. `CameraManager` class:
   - Provides methods to access and control camera devices.
   - `getCameraIdList()`: Returns an array of camera IDs available on the device.
   - `getCameraCharacteristics(String cameraId)`: Returns the characteristics of a specific camera.

2. `CameraCharacteristics` class:
   - Provides static metadata about a camera device.
   - `get(CameraCharacteristics.Key<T> key)`: Retrieves a specific camera characteristic using its key.

3. `CameraDevice` class:
   - Represents a single camera device that can be opened for capturing images or streaming.
   - `createCaptureSession(List<Surface> outputs, CameraCaptureSession.StateCallback callback, Handler handler)`: Creates a capture session for the camera device.
   - `createCaptureRequest(int templateType)`: Creates a capture request for capturing images with specific settings.
   - `setRepeatingRequest(CaptureRequest request, CameraCaptureSession.CaptureCallback listener, Handler handler)`: Repeatedly captures images with the specified capture request.

4. `CameraCaptureSession` class:
   - Represents a configured capture session for the camera device.
   - `capture(CaptureRequest request, CameraCaptureSession.CaptureCallback listener, Handler handler)`: Captures a single image with the specified capture request.
   - `setRepeatingRequest(CaptureRequest request, CameraCaptureSession.CaptureCallback listener, Handler handler)`: Repeatedly captures images with the specified capture request.

5. `CaptureRequest` class:
   - Encapsulates the settings and target surfaces for a single image capture.
   - `Builder` inner class: Helps construct a CaptureRequest object.
   - `addTarget(Surface outputTarget)`: Adds a target surface to the capture request.

6. `CaptureResult` class:
   - Contains the result metadata for a single image capture.
   - `get(CaptureResult.Key<T> key)`: Retrieves a specific result metadata using its key.

7. `Surface` class:
   - Represents an output target for the camera image capture.
   - Various constructors to create a surface from different sources (e.g., SurfaceView, SurfaceTexture, ImageReader).

These are some of the important classes and their methods involved in the camera capture process using the `android.hardware.camera2` package. By utilizing these classes and their methods, you can control the camera device, create capture requests, configure capture sessions, capture images, and retrieve capture results in your Android application.

# [CaptureRequest](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/camera2/CaptureRequest)

In Android Camera2 API, the capture mode is determined by the template type used when creating a `CaptureRequest.Builder` object. The template types are predefined constants available in the `CameraDevice` class, and they define common use cases for capturing images. Here are some of the available capture modes and how to set them:

1. Still Image Capture:
   - Use `CameraDevice.TEMPLATE_STILL_CAPTURE` template.
   - Example:
     ```java
     CaptureRequest.Builder captureRequestBuilder = cameraDevice.createCaptureRequest(CameraDevice.TEMPLATE_STILL_CAPTURE);
     ```

2. Continuous Preview (Streaming) Capture:
   - Use `CameraDevice.TEMPLATE_PREVIEW` template.
   - Example:
     ```java
     CaptureRequest.Builder captureRequestBuilder = cameraDevice.createCaptureRequest(CameraDevice.TEMPLATE_PREVIEW);
     ```

3. Video Recording:
   - Use `CameraDevice.TEMPLATE_RECORD` template.
   - Example:
     ```java
     CaptureRequest.Builder captureRequestBuilder = cameraDevice.createCaptureRequest(CameraDevice.TEMPLATE_RECORD);
     ```

4. Burst Capture:
   - Use `CameraDevice.TEMPLATE_STILL_CAPTURE` template and set the `CaptureRequest.CONTROL_CAPTURE_INTENT` to `CaptureRequest.CONTROL_CAPTURE_INTENT_STILL_CAPTURE` and `CaptureRequest.CONTROL_AE_MODE` to `CaptureRequest.CONTROL_AE_MODE_ON_AUTO_FLASH`.
   - Example:
     ```java
     CaptureRequest.Builder captureRequestBuilder = cameraDevice.createCaptureRequest(CameraDevice.TEMPLATE_STILL_CAPTURE);
     captureRequestBuilder.set(CaptureRequest.CONTROL_CAPTURE_INTENT, CaptureRequest.CONTROL_CAPTURE_INTENT_STILL_CAPTURE);
     captureRequestBuilder.set(CaptureRequest.CONTROL_AE_MODE, CaptureRequest.CONTROL_AE_MODE_ON_AUTO_FLASH);
     ```

These are just a few examples of capture modes available in Camera2 API. You can explore more template types in the `CameraDevice` class based on your specific requirements.

After setting the capture mode using the appropriate template type, you can further customize the capture request by adding additional parameters such as the target `Surface` and other settings like exposure, focus, and flash control.

[Camera capture sessions and requests](https://developer.android.com/training/camera2/capture-sessions-requests)

Here's an example of how you can create a CaptureRequest for recording audio and video using the Android Camera2 API:

```java
private void createCaptureRequest(CameraDevice cameraDevice, Surface previewSurface, Surface recordSurface) {
    try {
        // Create a capture request builder
        CaptureRequest.Builder captureRequestBuilder = cameraDevice.createCaptureRequest(CameraDevice.TEMPLATE_RECORD);
        
        // Set the target surfaces for the capture request
        captureRequestBuilder.addTarget(previewSurface);
        captureRequestBuilder.addTarget(recordSurface);
        
        // Set the desired capture parameters
        captureRequestBuilder.set(CaptureRequest.CONTROL_MODE, CameraMetadata.CONTROL_MODE_AUTO);
        captureRequestBuilder.set(CaptureRequest.CONTROL_AF_MODE, CameraMetadata.CONTROL_AF_MODE_CONTINUOUS_VIDEO);
        captureRequestBuilder.set(CaptureRequest.CONTROL_AE_MODE, CameraMetadata.CONTROL_AE_MODE_ON_AUTO_FLASH);
        // Add more capture parameters as needed
        
        // Build the capture request
        CaptureRequest captureRequest = captureRequestBuilder.build();
        
        // Use the capture request to start the preview
        cameraCaptureSession.setRepeatingRequest(captureRequest, null, null);
    } catch (CameraAccessException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```

In this example, we assume that you already have a `CameraDevice` object and a `CameraCaptureSession` set up. The `previewSurface` is the surface where you want to display the preview, and the `recordSurface` is the surface where you want to record the audio and video data.

You can modify the capture parameters according to your requirements. The example sets the control mode, autofocus mode, and auto-exposure mode to suitable values for recording video. You can add more parameters and customize them based on your app's needs.

Note that you'll need to handle the permission requests and surface setup separately before calling this method. Additionally, make sure you have the necessary permissions and surface configurations in place before starting the camera capture session.

Remember to release the resources properly when you're done with the camera and capture session.

1. `captureRequestBuilder.set(CaptureRequest.CONTROL_MODE, CameraMetadata.CONTROL_MODE_AUTO);`
   - This line sets the control mode for the capture request to "auto." In auto mode, the camera device automatically adjusts various parameters, such as focus, exposure, and white balance, based on the scene conditions. This allows the camera to optimize the image capture settings for different scenarios.

2. `captureRequestBuilder.set(CaptureRequest.CONTROL_AF_MODE, CameraMetadata.CONTROL_AF_MODE_CONTINUOUS_VIDEO);`
   - This line sets the autofocus (AF) mode to "continuous video" mode. In continuous video AF mode, the camera continuously adjusts focus while recording video to ensure that the subject remains in focus. It continuously analyzes the video frames and makes adjustments as necessary to maintain focus on moving subjects.

3. `captureRequestBuilder.set(CaptureRequest.CONTROL_AE_MODE, CameraMetadata.CONTROL_AE_MODE_ON_AUTO_FLASH);`
   - This line sets the auto-exposure (AE) mode to "auto flash" mode. In auto flash mode, the camera device automatically determines whether to use the flash while capturing images or recording video. It analyzes the scene conditions, such as low light or backlighting, and triggers the flash if necessary to ensure proper exposure.

By setting these capture request parameters, you are configuring the camera to operate in an automatic mode, allowing it to adjust focus, exposure, and flash settings based on the scene conditions. This helps in capturing high-quality video with proper focus and exposure levels.

Please note that the specific consequences of these settings may vary depending on the device and camera capabilities. It's recommended to test your app on different devices to ensure consistent behavior across different camera implementations.

What is the difference between the following two?

First:
```java
private void createCaptureRequest(CameraDevice cameraDevice, Surface previewSurface, Surface recordSurface) {
    try {
        // Create a capture request builder
        CaptureRequest.Builder captureRequestBuilder = cameraDevice.createCaptureRequest(CameraDevice.TEMPLATE_RECORD);
        
        // Set the target surfaces for the capture request
        captureRequestBuilder.addTarget(previewSurface);
        captureRequestBuilder.addTarget(recordSurface);
        
        // Set the desired capture parameters
        captureRequestBuilder.set(CaptureRequest.CONTROL_MODE, CameraMetadata.CONTROL_MODE_AUTO);
        captureRequestBuilder.set(CaptureRequest.CONTROL_AF_MODE, CameraMetadata.CONTROL_AF_MODE_CONTINUOUS_VIDEO);
        captureRequestBuilder.set(CaptureRequest.CONTROL_AE_MODE, CameraMetadata.CONTROL_AE_MODE_ON_AUTO_FLASH);
        // Add more capture parameters as needed
        
        // Build the capture request
        CaptureRequest captureRequest = captureRequestBuilder.build();
        
        // Use the capture request to start the preview
        cameraCaptureSession.setRepeatingRequest(captureRequest, null, null);
    } catch (CameraAccessException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```
Second:
```java
private void startStreaming() {
    // Create a capture request for streaming
    try {
        CaptureRequest.Builder captureRequestBuilder = cameraDevice.createCaptureRequest(CameraDevice.TEMPLATE_PREVIEW);
        captureRequestBuilder.addTarget(captureSession.getSurface());

        // Start streaming
        captureSession.setRepeatingRequest(captureRequestBuilder.build(), null, null);
    } catch (CameraAccessException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```

The main difference between the two code snippets is the template used to create the CaptureRequest and the set of target surfaces.

In the first code snippet:
- The template used to create the CaptureRequest is `CameraDevice.TEMPLATE_RECORD`. This template is typically used when capturing video or recording audio-video content. It sets up the camera parameters optimized for recording purposes.
- Two target surfaces are added to the CaptureRequest: `previewSurface` and `recordSurface`. These surfaces define the output destinations for the captured data. In this case, the previewSurface is likely used to display the camera preview on the screen, and the recordSurface is used to record the video.

On the other hand, in the second code snippet:
- The template used to create the CaptureRequest is `CameraDevice.TEMPLATE_PREVIEW`. This template is used for a live camera preview without explicitly capturing the frames. It sets up the camera parameters optimized for real-time preview purposes.
- Only one target surface is added to the CaptureRequest, which is obtained from the captureSession (`captureSession.getSurface()`). This surface is typically associated with a preview view or a SurfaceTexture for displaying the camera preview on the screen.

So, the key difference lies in the template used and the number of target surfaces. The first code snippet is more suited for capturing video and recording audio-video content, while the second code snippet is focused on providing a live camera preview without explicitly capturing the frames.

# Can we use both the front and back camera at the sme time?

Yes, it is possible to use both the front and back cameras simultaneously on some devices. This feature is commonly known as "dual-camera" or "multi-camera" support.

To use both cameras simultaneously, you would typically create two separate CameraDevices, one for the front camera and one for the back camera. You can use the CameraManager to obtain the IDs of the available cameras and then open each camera individually.

Once you have both camera devices open, you can create separate CaptureSessions for each camera and configure them to capture or stream images simultaneously. Each CaptureSession will have its own set of CaptureRequest objects and target surfaces.

However, it's important to note that not all devices support simultaneous usage of both front and back cameras. The availability of this feature depends on the device's hardware capabilities and the specific Camera2 API implementation on the device. Therefore, it's recommended to check the device's documentation or test the functionality on the target device to ensure its support for dual-camera usage.
